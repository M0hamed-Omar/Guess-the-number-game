# Guess-the-number-game
A fun and simple "Guess the Number" game coded in C++. The program generates a random number between 0 and 20, and the player must guess it by receiving hints ("Too high" or "Too low") after each guess. Once the player guesses correctly, they win! The game also offers the option to play again after each round.
